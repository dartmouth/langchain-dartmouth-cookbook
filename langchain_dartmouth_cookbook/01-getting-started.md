# Getting started

To get started with the examples in this cookbook, you need Python (at least version 3.10) and a code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) installed on your system. Check out our [helpful research guide](https://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/c.php?g=1313588&p=9658071) for support!

Once you have Python installed, you can install `langchain_dartmouth` by running this command in your terminal:

```
pip install langchain_dartmouth
```

You should now be able to run any of the example notebooks on your system! Either download individual notebooks using the button at the top (choose the `*.ipynb` file format), or clone this repository entirely:

```
git clone https://github.com/dartmouth/langchain-dartmouth-cookbook.git
```

Now you can open the cloned folder in your code editor and run any of the notebooks!
